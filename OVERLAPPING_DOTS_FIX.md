# Overlapping Dots Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
In the Dot-to-Dot game, when two dots share the same position (x, y coordinates), the dot with the higher number would appear on top, making the smaller numbered dot invisible or hard to see.

## Identified Overlapping Dots
1. **Cute House picture**: 
   - Dot 1 and Dot 6 both at position (200, 80)
2. **Friendly Fish picture**: 
   - Dot 1 and Dot 9 both at position (80, 150)

## Solution
Added a sorting function `getSortedDotsForRendering()` that ensures when dots share the same position, the smaller numbered dot is rendered last (and thus appears on top).

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. Added Helper Function (lines 157-176 in DotToDotGame.tsx)
```typescript
const getSortedDotsForRendering = (): Dot[] => {
  const sortedDots = [...currentPic.dots];
  
  sortedDots.sort((a, b) => {
    // If dots are in the same position
    if (a.x === b.x && a.y === b.y) {
      // Sort by number in descending order (larger numbers first)
      // This way smaller numbers will be rendered last and appear on top
      return b.number - a.number;
    }
    // For dots in different positions, maintain original order based on id
    return a.id - b.id;
  });
  
  return sortedDots;
};
```

#### 2. Updated Rendering Logic (line 224 in DotToDotGame.tsx)
Changed from:
```typescript
{currentPic.dots.map((dot) => (
```
To:
```typescript
{getSortedDotsForRendering().map((dot) => (
```

#### 3. Added Comprehensive Tests (DotToDotGame.test.tsx)
- Tests for overlapping dots in both Cute House and Friendly Fish pictures
- Verification that smaller numbered dots appear later in DOM order (on top)
- Tests to ensure non-overlapping dots maintain their original order
- Full game functionality tests to ensure no regression

## How It Works
1. **For overlapping dots**: Sorts by number in descending order (6, 1) so dot 1 renders last and appears on top
2. **For non-overlapping dots**: Maintains original order based on dot ID to preserve existing behavior
3. **SVG rendering**: In SVG, elements rendered later appear on top of earlier elements

## Result
- ✅ Dot 1 now appears on top of Dot 6 in Cute House
- ✅ Dot 1 now appears on top of Dot 9 in Friendly Fish  
- ✅ All existing game functionality preserved
- ✅ Non-overlapping dots maintain their original visual order
- ✅ Performance impact minimal (sorting happens once per picture)

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- Overlapping dots are handled correctly
- DOM order reflects the correct layering
- Game mechanics remain unchanged
- All pictures work as expected
